<!-- Configuring SAML-based single sign-on with EdCast -->

<p>The edX EdCast integration uses SAML-based single sign-on between edX and EdCast.</p>
<p>To establish a SAML connection with EdCast, edX needs to configure your SAML identity provider (IdP) profile using your EdCast IdP metadata. The metadata includes configuration information such as your entity ID, endpoints, and signing certificate. EdX needs the identity provider metadata URL for both your beta environment and your production environment. Contact EdCast Support to get your EdCast metadata URL.</p>
