<!--Importing edX content to EdCast content items -->
<p>After you have provided edX with the information we need to configure the EdCast integration, edX will work with you to create a curated catalog of edX courses that are relevant to your organizationâ€™s learners. You then work with your EdCast representative to import your edX course catalog into your EdCast account.</p>
